# Start Here

If this is your first time with fhEVM, this page is the fastest way to get a working example and understand what is happening.

## 1) Install and run an example

```bash
npm install
npm run test:mocked
```

## 2) Pick a beginner example

- **FHE Counter** (encrypted counter operations)
- **Encrypt Single Value** (store one encrypted value)

## 3) Read the example page

Each example page includes:
- A short explanation of the concept
- The full contract and test (tabs)
- Pitfalls to avoid

## 4) Generate your own example

Once you are comfortable, use the generator:

```bash
npm run create fhe-counter ./output/fhe-counter
```

That creates a standalone repo you can customize.
