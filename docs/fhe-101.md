# FHE 101 (Plain Language)

Fully Homomorphic Encryption lets a smart contract operate on encrypted values without revealing them on-chain.

## Key ideas

- **Encrypted values are bound** to a contract and a user.
- **Input proofs** show the encrypted input matches the expected contract + signer.
- **Permissions** are required to decrypt results.

## The 3 permissions you will see

- `FHE.allowThis(value)` lets the contract operate on the ciphertext later.
- `FHE.allow(value, user)` lets a user decrypt.
- `FHE.allowTransient(value, contract)` grants one-transaction permission (useful for multi-contract flows).

## Public decryption

Some examples opt in to public decryption using `FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable`. This is only safe if the value is meant to be public after an on-chain proof step.

## Typical flow

1) User encrypts input off-chain (bound to contract + user)
2) Contract verifies the input proof and stores the ciphertext
3) Contract grants permissions (allowThis / allow)
4) Later, user or authorized party decrypts
